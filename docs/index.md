## Overview

`Erb3/ui` is Erb3's personal bag of Vue components! It is forked from Modrinth's [Omorphia], and the main differences are:

- No typesafety
- Less border radius

## Getting started

Follow the instructions on the [‚ûú **setup page** üõ†Ô∏è](/setup).

## Documentation

The code highlighter used on the documentation has an issue where codeblocks aren't properly highlighter when using `vue`.
This is why some codeblocks are labeled as `javascript`, but it is actually just Vue code!

## Planned components
